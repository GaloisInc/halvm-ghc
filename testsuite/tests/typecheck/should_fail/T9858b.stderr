    No instance for (Typeable (Eq Int => Int))
      (maybe you haven't applied enough arguments to a function?)
      arising from a use of ‘typeRep’
    In the expression: typeRep (Proxy :: Proxy (Eq Int => Int))
    In an equation for ‘test’:
        test = typeRep (Proxy :: Proxy (Eq Int => Int))
